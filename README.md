# Software that will be used during the course:

### File transfer to Mana supercomputing cluster
[Filezilla (client)](https://filezilla-project.org) or [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/download/)

### Text editors
[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Mac),  or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) (PC) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

- [Geneious](https://www.geneious.com/) -- if your lab has a license

### Neighbor joining / maximum parsimony analyses
- [Paup*](http://phylosolutions.com/paup-test/)

### Maximum likelihood analyses
- [IQ-tree](http://www.iqtree.org/) in an [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) environment on the [Mana cluster](https://datascience.hawaii.edu/hpc/)
NB. will be explained in class

### Bayesian analyses
