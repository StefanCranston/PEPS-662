# Software that will be used during the course

## Install on your computer locally:

### File transfer software
[Filezilla (client)](https://filezilla-project.org) or [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/download/)

### A text editor
[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Mac),  [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) (PC) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). BBEdit and Notepad++ are lightweight text editors, Visual Studio Code is a larger program that includes a terminal interface to directly run and debug scripts (like e.g. in RStudio).

### Sequence alignment / editing
[Aliview](http://www.ormbunkar.se/aliview/downloads/) or, if your lab has a license, [Geneious](https://www.geneious.com/)

### Processing results files
- [Tracer](https://beast.community/tracer) for visualizing Bayesian convergence statistics
- [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
- [the R package RevGadgets](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/intro/revgadgets.html)

### Neighbor joining / maximum parsimony analyses
- [Paup*](http://phylosolutions.com/paup-test/)

## Software that we will use on the [Mana cluster](https://datascience.hawaii.edu/hpc/) supercomputing cluster:

- [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) environments
- [IQ-tree](http://www.iqtree.org/) maximum likelihood
- [MrBayes](http://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/) Bayesian inference
- [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/) probablistic graphical modelling
